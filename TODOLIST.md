# TO DO
List of tasks and ideas for implementation

**Tasks**
- [x] Client/Server distinction
- [x] Right and left handed (plays with [A, S, D] and [LEFT, UP, RIGHT] arrow keys)
- [x] Enemy generation algorithm
- [ ] Player 2 mechanic [guitar hero] : WIP
- [ ] Sound Effects: BGM/Score/Miss : WIP

**Ideas**
- Input Server's IP at Runtime
- Players input name
- Best scores in database
- Standalone client app (for quicker testing adjustments) maybe?

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

Player 2 Mechanic [Guitar Hero]:

	The basic mechanics are working.
	
	Needs some improvements on the gameplay itself:
	
		- Score points (?)
		- Punishment when failed to score a point (To prevent the player from pressing
		the buttons constantly)
